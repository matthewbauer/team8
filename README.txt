-Most code was edited in code.js
-The data from data.js was used as the input
-The index.html runs the program
-The file d3.js is a library that contains functions used for the functionality
-The main approach for this project was to use the previously defined d3.js libraries to accomplish goals for the project
-Most naming conventions for variables and functions were standard
-Used the data from data.js to parse each node and obtain information from each one
-The primary approach for the product was to use the edge_instruments and edge_positions to design links between nodes
